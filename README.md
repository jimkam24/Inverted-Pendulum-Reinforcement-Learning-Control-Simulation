# Inverted Pendulum Reinforcement Learning Control Simulation
This project contains the code for the simulation process to control an inverted pendulum using Q-learning and DQN algorithms.
The project is part of the 2025-2026 ECE NTUA Neurofuzzy Control courses and consists of a virtual simulation of the experiment described in the paper: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280071
